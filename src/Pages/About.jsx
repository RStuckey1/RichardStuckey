      <h2>I have a diverse background with a unique skillset. I am a mechanically inclined, yet creative person. 
        I have a love of music that goes back to my childhood. My father owned a stero store in downtown KCMO </h2>
      <h2>This was before the big box stores exsisted and small busiesses ruled the land.</h2>
      <h2>Living in a world of music, I pursued my passion, learning woodwinds with a focus of the Alto/Tenor Saxophone</h2>
      <h2>the instrument I loved from the jazz I grew up with. I then went to the University of Kansas trying to spread</h2>
      <h2>my love of music in the music education program.</h2>
