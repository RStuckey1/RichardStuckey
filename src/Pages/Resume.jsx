            <h2>Experience Highlights</h2>
            <h3>Kansas City Zoo & Aquarium (Life Support Systems Manager)</h3>
            <h4 className="resume">SOBELLA Oceanarium</h4>
            <p>From conceptual meetings to opening, I contributed to the design and commissioning of the Life Support Systems and the building</p>
            <p>management controls systems.</p>
            <h4>Stingray Bay</h4>
            <p>This was my first ground-up touch tank exhibit. I contributed to the design, installation, and commissioning of the exhibit.</p>
            <p>I managed the Life Support Systems, and the building automation systems. All of the sensors and controllers utilized remote monitoring</p>
            <p>via a web applicaion interface</p>
            <h4>Helzberg Penguin Plaza</h4>
            <p>This building had many manual procedures that I upgraded to remote monitoring/controls. This included the ozone system for three large</p>
            <p>aquariums, flowmeters for both a cold penguin(120k gallons) and warm pengiun(30k gallons) exhibits.</p>
            <p>During this time I identified many processes and procedures that could be improved.</p>
            <p>Examples:</p>
            <p>-Changing exhibit salt suppliers, saving $65,000 per year</p>
            <p>-Cutting out middleman supply houses, buying parts from manufacture for pumps, ozone equipment, etc.</p>
            <p>saving over $30,000 per year.</p>
